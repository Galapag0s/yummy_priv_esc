# Yum(my) Privilege Escalation
A simple bash implementation of a yum privilege escalation as seen in GTFOBins. (Please note, this requires that a user can run yum with sudo.)

This is a simple bash script which runs the privilege escalation process related to [Yum](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/yum/).

For a basic explanation of what's actually going on here see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64635912/yum-privilege-escalation).

** This code is not mine, just a basic script you can upload an run **
